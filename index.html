          <h2>üë§ About Me </h2>
          <p>I‚Äôm a passionate and dedicated developer who enjoys solving problems and building creative solutions through code. My focus is on writing clean, efficient programs and constantly improving my understanding of software development principles. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to real-world projects that push me out of my comfort zone. My long-term goal is to become a versatile and skilled developer capable of designing and building software that makes a real impact. <a href="about.html">‚Üí [Read More About Me]</a></p>
          <h3>üöÄ Featured Projects</h3>
            <p>Below are a few examples of the kinds of projects I work on, each chosen to highlight different skills and levels of complexity. My beginner projects focus on core programming fundamentals and simple problem-solving. My intermediate work often involves user interaction, data handling, or external APIs. At the advanced level, I challenge myself with larger projects that require planning, architecture, and a deeper understanding of algorithms and design patterns. Each one represents a step forward in my development journey.<a href="Projects">‚Üí [See All Projects]</a></p>

            <h4>üõ†Ô∏è Skills</h4>
            <p>Throughout my projects, I have worked with a range of programming languages and tools that support modern software development. My main focus is on Python and Java, but I also have experience with Git for version control, SQL for database management, and HTML/CSS for creating basic user interfaces. I regularly explore new libraries, frameworks, and programming techniques to deepen my understanding and make my work more efficient and effective. These skills continue to grow as I build more advanced projects and tackle more ambitious challenges.</p>

            <h5>üíª My Coding Journey & Development Process</h5>
            <p>My programming journey began with HTML, where I learned how to structure the foundation of a website and understand how the web functions beneath the surface. Moving into CSS brought creativity into the mix, showing me how design and logic combine to shape user experience through colour, layout, and responsiveness. Once comfortable with front-end structure and styling, I transitioned to Python, which became my favourite for its versatility and problem-solving power. I started building small projects and automations that taught me how to apply logic to real-world challenges.To stay organised, I use Goodnotes as a digital logbook ‚Äî documenting errors, solutions, and ideas as I work. This habit helps me track progress, recognise patterns in mistakes, and refine my approach over time. It‚Äôs become a key part of my workflow and growth as a developer.Every project I create builds on the last, with cleaner code, clearer structure, and more deliberate design. For me, coding isn‚Äôt just about syntax ‚Äî it‚Äôs about learning to think critically, create intentionally, and grow with every line of code I write.</p>
