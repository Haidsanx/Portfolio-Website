        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p class="black">This section showcases the <em>projects I’m working on and the ones I’ve completed so far</em>. Each one marks a step forward as I <em>learn new languages, try different ideas, and take on more challenging builds</em>. I like using my projects as a way to test what I’ve learned — whether that’s a small layout in HTML and CSS or something more complex once I move deeper into Python. Every project has its own purpose, and I usually add <em>notes about what inspired it, what I learned while building it, and where I want to take it next</em>. Over time, this section will show how my skills have evolved and how my approach to coding keeps improving with each new idea I bring to life.</p>

        <h3>In Progress / Upcoming Projects</h3>
        <p> This section highlights the projects I’m currently developing and the ideas I’m planning to build next. Right now, I’m focused on creating Python projects that expand on what I’ve already learned through HTML and CSS. I’ve been building small programs to explore how logic, automation, and data handling work together, while also experimenting with different ways to make my code more efficient and readable. Some of these projects are simple — like tools that automate basic tasks — while others are more experimental and push me to learn new concepts as I go.As I continue to improve, I plan to integrate some of these Python projects directly into this website, so it becomes more interactive and reflects my growth in real time. My goal is to move toward creating complete applications that combine both front-end and back-end elements, bridging everything I’ve learned so far into a single, cohesive project.
</p>
        <p>Current focus for this project:</p>
        <address>With the HTML and CSS complete, my next focus is on creating <strong><span class="highlight">Python projects</span></strong> that will be integrated into this website. These will showcase my progress as I start working on automation, logic-based challenges, and small applications that expand beyond front-end development</address>

        <h3>Completed Projects</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>HTML portfolio website</dt>
            <dd>This was my first full project — building the foundation of my personal portfolio using only <strong><span class="highlight"> HTML </span></strong>. It helped me understand how to structure a website properly and organise content in a clear, readable way. I think that it is <strong><span class="highlight">Impressive</span></strong> for a first project and a solid starting point for everything I’ll build next.</dd>
            <dt>CSS Styling and Design</dt>
            <dd>This project focuses on bringing the portfolio to life through <strong><span class="highlight">CSS</span></strong>. It’s where I experimented with <strong><span class="highlight">colours, layouts, and responsive styling</span></strong> to make the website more dynamic and visually appealing. This stage really showed me how <strong>design and structure</strong> work together to create a complete experience.</dd>
