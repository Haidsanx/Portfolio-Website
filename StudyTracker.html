        <h2>StudyTracker</h2>
        <p class="white">This page is to showcase the <em>StudyTracker project I have developed using Python</em>. StudyTracker is a simple application designed to help users monitor and improve their study habits. The project focuses on <em>logging study sessions, setting goals, and tracking progress over time</em>. It provides users with insights into their learning patterns, helping them identify areas for improvement and stay motivated. Through this project, I aimed to enhance my understanding of Python programming, particularly in handling user input, data storage, and basic data analysis. StudyTracker serves as a practical tool for students and lifelong learners looking to optimize their study routines and achieve their academic goals.</p>
        
        <h3>Backround; The "Why did i make this app" </h3>
        <p>I created this app because I wanted to build better study habits and truly understand how I was spending my time. I often found it difficult to see whether I was focusing too much on one subject or neglecting another, so I developed a simple yet effective tool to help track my progress. The idea was to make something minimalist and easy to use, but still motivating and insightful — a space where learning feels structured without being overwhelming.
            
        The app lets users add their study sessions and filter them by week or subject, helping them visualize where their time goes and how their efforts change over time. It’s not just about tracking hours, but about understanding patterns and making better decisions for balanced learning. I wanted this to be something that could help others as well — a tool that quietly supports consistency, reflection, and growth in a way that feels personal and encouraging.</p>

        <h3>Skills learnt</h3>
        <p> This section highlights the skills I developed while creating the StudyTracker project. Throughout this project, I gained a solid understanding of Python programming fundamentals, including variables, data types, and control structures. I learned how to handle user input effectively, allowing users to log their study sessions and set goals interactively. Additionally, I explored basic data storage techniques, such as using lists and dictionaries to organize and manage study data. The project also introduced me to simple data analysis methods, enabling me to generate insights from the logged information. Overall, StudyTracker helped me build a strong foundation in Python while also enhancing my problem-solving and project management skills.</p>

        <p>I used many different coding languages and elements to create this app such as the following:Python, Flask, Java, Javascript, HTML and CSS to create a comprehensive and functional application as seen in the video demonstration</p>
