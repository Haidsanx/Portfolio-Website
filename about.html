        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="black">
            I’m Haider, and I got into coding because I’ve always wanted to build
            something from the ground up and be able to call it my own. So far, I’ve
            been learning HTML, and my proudest achievement has been creating this
            website completely from scratch using only code. While I’ve started with
            web development, I’m also looking forward to learning Python and Java so
            I can branch out into different kinds of projects and explore how
            software can be applied in a variety of ways. Away from coding, sports
            play a big part in my life.<span class="highlight">
                I follow football, F1, and cricket closely, and I support Manchester
                United and Ferrari</span>
            — two teams that keep things exciting, even if they test my patience
            sometimes. I also enjoy playing sports myself and like the discipline
            and energy that comes with staying active. When I want to slow down, I
            turn to books, especially thriller novels, because I enjoy stories that
            keep me hooked with suspense and detail. I’m currently studying
            biochemistry, a subject that fascinates me because of the incredible
            depth and level of detail it requires. I’ve always been curious about
            how things work on a fundamental level, and biochemistry gives me a way
            to explore that in a scientific context. Looking ahead, I want to keep
            pushing myself in both coding and science — building projects, learning
            new skills, and finding ways to combine creativity, logic, and
            problem-solving in everything I do.
